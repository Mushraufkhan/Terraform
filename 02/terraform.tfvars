#   In your case, the CIDR notation issue was due to subnetting rules. For a /29 subnet, the starting address must be a multiple of 8 because a /29 prefix allows 8 IP addresses in total (but only 6 usable ones due to reserved addresses).
# So if you're working within the 20.0.1.X range, valid starting addresses for a /29 subnet would be:
# - 20.0.1.0/29
# - 20.0.1.8/29
# - 20.0.1.16/29
# â€¦and so on.
# Your initial address 20.0.1.1/29 was invalid because 1 is not divisible by 8.
